- Need to be able to show CTFs on the scoreboard, I want individual bug bounties, but also there needs to be a page for open ctf, and a page for people to submit the flags to get credit for them

- Have a page with all ctfs, and pages for each ctf

- Need to add a ctf table in the database to keep track of all ctfs

- Need a page to create ctfs

- Need a page to edit a ctf, adding challenges

- Finish integrating CLEAS authentication

- Make sure we have a page for bug bounties (open and closed), each should have a prize, boundaries, and there should be an admin page to edit all of them
