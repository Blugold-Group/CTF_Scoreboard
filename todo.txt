- Need to be able to show CTFs on the scoreboard, I want individual bug bounties, but also there needs to be a page for open ctf, and a page for people to submit the flags to get credit for them

- Finish integrating CLEAS authentication

- Want to add a badge saying 'closing soon' if the end date is within a week

- Add a resources page with the slides from each week and resources to learn the topic taught
