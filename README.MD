## Hall of History

This server was created by Jack Hagem the founder of the cyber club over a weekend in October 2024

## Historical Notes

The CLEAS was originally meant to authenticate id tags unique to each club member, allowing us to see who unlocked what when. The lock permissions were meant to be tied to user accounts on this server, so any mention of locks in the code references that. Ultimately we just used a basic nfc lock which uses one nfc password which was copied to several tags to be shared by all members.
